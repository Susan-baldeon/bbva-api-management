# Red Hat API Integration &amp; Management Workshop

This is a subset of labs from the Red Hat API Integration &amp; Management Workshop. This workshop will guide you on your journey to create your first API managed by Red Hat 3scale API Management. We loosely base it on a very basic POC we would normally roll out.

The workshop is intended to be delivered in person, but will provide enough guidance for self-paced consumption.
